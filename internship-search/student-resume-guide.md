# Student Resume Guide

### Overview <a id="Overview"></a>

Writing a resume might seem pretty straightforward, but there are lots of nuances. After all, it’s the first thing recruiters will read about you. It’s crucial to make a good first impression.

…And you need to make that impression fast. [Recruiters spend an average of six seconds reviewing a resume.](https://cdn.theladders.net/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf) You heard that right. Six seconds.

Almost all that time is spent on your name, companies, job titles, start/end dates, school, major, and project titles. Everything on your resume should be tailored towards helping recruiters find these key pieces of info as fast as possible.

#### If you don’t have a LinkedIn profile, create one now. <a id="If-you-don&#x2019;t-have-a-LinkedIn-profile-createnbspone-now"></a>

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) enables recruiters to find you and helps you maintain your professional network. Plus, you need it for cold-emailing recruiters later. First, search LinkedIn profiles of software engineers for good examples of how a profile should look.

Create your profile, and add as much of the information to the profile as you can. Check out our [LinkedIn creation guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vU29fx3ILkl1etW4xLvy_1HXdvqyj4io3396-P8e8Bs/edit) for more information. Treat it as a digital extended resume, and often the LinkedIn profile can be even more detailed than a resume. Include all your work experience, projects, and a summary at the top. Search other LinkedIn profiles of software engineers for good examples.

### Key Resume Guidelines <a id="Key-Resume-Guidelines"></a>

Here are some important guidelines for your resume:

**What to include:**

* Include the languages, frameworks, platforms and tools that you are most familiar with
* Include projects that showcase things you’re passionate about and your technical experience. Include a link for each project if you can.
* Include links to your GitHub, LinkedIn and a website \(if applicable\)
* Look at the job description and make sure to include relevant skills/experiences. E.g. if you’re applying for a mobile role and you’ve used languages they’re asking for, make sure to list them in the work/project descriptions!

**Easy to scan:**

* Stick to one page.
* Keep it black and white if you’re not skilled at design. Colors are noisy.
* Stick to a standard format \(chronological, no weird fonts, 10.5 to 12 pt font size, 0.5 to 1 inch margins\). Standard formats are more readable by resume-parsing programs and easier to skim by recruiters.
* Keep it concise. Text walls discourage readers.

**Highlight the key points:**

* Make your name big.
* Highlight company names, job titles, start/end dates, school name, major and project titles.
* Important content should be higher up. For a student, the order of importance is usually Education &gt; Experience &gt; Projects &gt; Skills.

**Cut the fluff:**

* Objective and Summary are generally unnecessary.
* Descriptions should say something tangible. _“Exceptional team player”_ doesn’t work. _“Increased user conversion rates by 20%”_ does. This should describe the project specifically and quantify impact if possible.
* People without technical background will be reading your resume, so get rid of convoluted details.

**Don’t neglect the details:**

* Include the higher of your cumulative GPA and your major GPA. If they’re both less than 3.5, leave it off.
* Don’t include anything you wouldn’t be comfortable answering questions about. Most people make this mistake when listing their skills.

After finishing your resume, have your peers review it. Ask them to be honest and harsh. If you then want even more tips, check out [this article](https://www.careercup.com/resume).

#### You can also include CodePath classes and projects <a id="You-can-also-include-CodePath-classes-and-projects"></a>

* If you took our Mobile App Design course, you can add this as an extracurricular activity: `CodePath.org University: Mobile Application Design course`. You can choose to add a note like “Attended 12-week program which involved designing and scoping our own mobile app and building a fully functional Flash Card app from scratch over several coding labs.”
* If you built projects in our courses that are on your github, be sure to include those in a “Projects” section alongside other portfolio pieces. Be sure to describe the project \(“Built and published a functional Instagram-like Android app which allows users to share photos with friends and family”\) **and** include a link to the Github repo.
* CodePath is listed as a school in LinkedIn, so you can also add us in your Education section and it should autocomplete with the icon and info. You could include images or even video demo of your app at the end of the course. There’s also a section in LinkedIn for projects.
* If you're a Tech Fellow, [check out this guide ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpwOZGWf-QJf7gtSWWqb72HhUxEAsNdrYTdv_W9mwf8/edit?usp=sharing)demonstrating how to add your leadership experience to your resume.

#### How is a resume actually used? <a id="How-is-a-resume-actually-used"></a>

Once you’ve prepared your resume, you might find it is helpful to think about how the resume is actually used in practice by recruiters. Here are a few examples:

* **Career Fairs**. You will hand out your resume at career fairs \(at your campus, or at CodePath virtual career fairs\). The company representative \(usually an engineer or recruiter\) will spend the cursory 6 seconds looking it over, and then ask the “tell me about yourself” question. It’s really important to be able to provide a _concise and enthusiastic pitch_ about why you are interested in the company-- essentially your cover letter in verbal form. At career fairs, many companies actually assign a number to each student about their likelihood to be a good fit.
* **Submitting Online**. Perhaps the primary way your resume will be used is as the first touch point with a recruiter at a company after you apply for a technical role, either an internship or full-time postion. A technical recruiter receives a lot of resumes in most cases, and they are the one processing incoming applications. Usually they will spend about 6 seconds reviewing each one, and then quickly sort applicants based on past internship/work experience, school/major, projects, cover letter, and other things that stand out. This will often result in tagging with a 👍🏽 and 👎🏽 or a similar scoring mechanic in their tracking system.

ℹ️ Remember that connecting with people and working through referrals can often **make all the difference in getting access** to a career opportunity. If you can chat with a recruiter at a career fair or at a meetup, you are **significantly more likely to be given a longer look** by them. This is not going to guarantee you an interview but you’ll fare much better than going into the general resume pile.
